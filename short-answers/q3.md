# Question

What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is different classes can have the same property and method names that do other things. This means that our program can reliably use different types of objects in the same way if they all descend from the same parent class.

```js
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("Vrooom");
  }
}

class SportsCar extends Car {
  // the constructor can be inherited too as long as the signature doesn't need changing

  drive() {
    // Method Override
    console.log("Stututu... Stututu..");
    super.drive(); // invoke the parent class method
    console.log("WHEEEEEEE!!!!");
  }
}
```
